Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's Course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in Coursera MOOC, by Johns Hopkins.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 


## Files

In the GitHut repo are presents four files:

* `readme.md` you are in;

* `CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data;

* `run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the cleaning and analyses required;

* `averages_data.txt` the output of the 5th step, uploaded in the course project's form.

The code takes for granted all the datasets are present in the same folder, such as unzipped.

The datasets used are **not** present in the GitHut repo. It has not been requested by the course assignment.   
It has been a matter of space only.  The unzipped file takes 61Mb while the directory that hosts all the unzipped datasets takes 261 Mb.  

It could be downloaded at [data for the project](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
